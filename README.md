# Krystal

This is an sample project to showcase different aspects of a microservices architecture with an example of a real-world application. The application under this context is an URL shortener and a HTTP redirector system. Just like a regular crystal refracts or in some sense redirects light (as Wikipedia says, in physics, refraction is the change in direction of a wave passing from one medium to another or from a gradual change in the medium), this software Krystal shortens an URL and redirects HTTP requests for the shortened web resources to their original sources.
